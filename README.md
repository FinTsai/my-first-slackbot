# finfinbot

### Introduction

finfinbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running finfinbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start finfin locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    finfin>

Then you can interact with finfin by typing `finfin help`.

    finfin> finfin help
    finfin animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    finfin help - Displays all of the help commands that finfin knows about.
    ...
